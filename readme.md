Since I was a child, I have always wanted to be an inventor. My sources of inspiration include real-life engineers (Skunk Works team lead "Kelly" Johnson) and fictional characters ("Racho" from the Hindi film 3 Idiots). 

My favorite villain has always Dr. Doofenshmirtz from the show Phineas and Ferb. Doofenshmirtz, a somewhat pitiful but enthusiastic villain, would introduce an evil invention in each episode. These inventions were as varied as they were ridiculous (Hot Dog Vendor Revenge-inator and Whale Translator-inator are two of my favorites). I decided to develop a Doofinator, which is effectively an mp3 jukebox with an IR receiver for remote actuation. On startup, the Doofinator plays one of doofenshmirtz's famous "jingles". Jukebox mode is then entered, and a playlist of songs sung by Doofenshmirtz begins to play.
